# hype-whatsover-prod

Private Cloudflare Worker service with one SQLite Durable Object per linked
WhatsApp account. The protocol engine is Rust compiled to WebAssembly; no
Container or remote desktop relay is used.

Each object owns a separate WASM instance, JS handle table, and async task queue.
The generated static factory prevents account I/O from sharing wasm-bindgen's
usual module singleton. The WASM module itself is compiled once by Cloudflare.
The instance initializer installs SDK wall and monotonic clocks before use;
Workers clocks advance at I/O boundaries. HTTP adapters use `redirect: "manual"`
and check status themselves because Workers rejects `redirect: "error"`.

Hype passes its server deployment stage to `start(account, stage)`. Each account
persists that stage for reconnects and advertises a desktop companion named
`HYPE` in production, or `HYPE {stage}` elsewhere (for example `HYPE preview`).
The SDK sends this identity only during pairing. An existing linked device must
be re-linked for WhatsApp to show the new name; updating the service alone does
not rename or unlink an existing device.

## Build and test

Install Rust with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, Bun, and
`wasm-bindgen-cli` version 0.2.130 (matching Cargo.lock). Then:

```sh
bun install
cd apps/whatsover-cloudflare
bun run types
bun run test
bun run check
bun run build
```

Tests build a `qualification` variant containing synthetic storage contract
checks. `build` rebuilds the production variant, removes those test exports,
and performs a Wrangler dry-run. Always build before deployment.

For local CLI use, see `packages/whatsover-engine/README.md`.

## Private service API

There is no public HTTP API: `workers_dev` and preview URLs are disabled, and
`fetch` returns 404. An authorized Hype server uses a service binding:

```toml
[[services]]
binding = "WHATSOVER"
service = "hype-whatsover-prod"
```

RPC methods are `start(account)`, `stop(account)`, `status(account)`,
`send(account, { requestId, to, text, replyTo?, reaction?, attachmentId? })`, `inbox(account, after, limit)`,
`outbox(account, limit)`, `result(account, requestId)`, `profile(account, jid)`,
`upload(account, options, bytes)`, and `media(account, chat, target)`. `probe()` checks SDK
clocks, Rust timers, and randomness. `diagnostics(account)` returns bounded SDK
source locations and allowlisted error categories, without log text or secrets.
Hype must authorize the user before calling them and derive the account ID on
the server. Never expose this binding through an unguarded generic RPC proxy.

Starting an account enables a recovery alarm; stopping disables it without
unlinking the device. Outgoing WhatsApp WebSockets cannot hibernate, so an enabled
24/7 account uses active Durable Object duration. No connection starts on deploy.

## Storage and failure behavior

The Rust backend implements the SDK's Signal, app-state, protocol, device, and
message-secret traits against DO SQLite. Related changes use one synchronous
transaction followed by `storage.sync()`. Read/modify/write sequences do not
yield until the whole batch has been submitted. Pending inbound records use
bounded reads, exact-byte revisions, and conditional replacement/deletion.

The inbox commits decrypted messages before ACK. The send journal records intent
before I/O, rejects conflicting request IDs, and preserves uncertain outcomes
after eviction. Session credentials are held only in DO storage. Local tests use
synthetic fixtures; any live local runtime state must use a private directory
outside this repository.

The send surface supports text, stored-message replies, reaction updates/removal,
images, WebP stickers, and Ogg Opus voice notes. Reply targets are resolved by
account/chat/sender/message ID; callers cannot supply arbitrary quote bodies.
Idempotency covers the recipient, text, quote, reaction, and opaque attachment ID.
Successful sends are also journaled as local conversation entries.

Media uploads are encrypted by the SDK. Only the opaque staged ID and display
metadata reach Hype; CDN URLs and cryptographic keys stay in private DO storage.
Staged descriptors expire after 24 hours. Uploads/downloads are capped at 8 MiB,
stickers at 512 KiB, and voice recordings at 10 minutes. Worker HTTP bodies have a
16 MiB hard cap before entering WASM. The SDK buffered download path decrypts in
place; its synchronous streaming DownloadLimits are intentionally not advertised
for Fetch. Declared sizes are checked before download and verified bytes are
checked afterward. Media operations serialize per account to bound memory.
View-once content is neither downloaded nor quoted.

Inbox projections backfill existing private payloads without exposing protocol
credentials. Unknown payloads retain their sequence as unsupported so polling
continues. Profile lookup combines contact-sync names, push names, group subjects,
usernames, and SDK-provided PN/LID aliases. Thumbnail fetches accept only HTTPS
WhatsApp/CDN hosts, reject redirects, and cap bodies at 128 KiB. Missing/private
photos stay null. Display profiles are cached for an hour; contact-sync updates
invalidate affected aliases. Contact display updates are drained during status
polls, alarms, and clean shutdown; unlike inbound message content, an update just
before an abrupt process loss is not guaranteed durable.

Deployment and local runtime tests do not by themselves prove WhatsApp operation
on Cloudflare. Final qualification requires QR linking, an approved send, an
incoming reply, and recovery after a service restart, through Hype's admin UI.

An unlinked handshake has reached `PairingQrCode` on the deployed service and
on the native CLI. This confirms that Cloudflare can open the WhatsApp connection
and complete the initial handshake; it does not yet prove linked message delivery.
The deployed service also passed an unlinked stop/start check: it produced a new
pairing reference while preserving the device's Noise key, identity key, and
advertising secret in SQLite. The check compared those values only in memory,
sent no messages, and stopped the qualification account afterward. Linked-session
recovery still requires pairing and the end-to-end checks above.


## Voice and video call implementation boundary

The browser, account bridge and native relay implement direct calls. The pinned SDK documents `voip-control`, portable
`voip-mlow`/`voip-encoded`, and `voip-relay-native`. See
[SDK voice calls](https://whatsapp-rust.jlucaso.com/guides/voip-calls).
Its `RelayTransportProvider` can supply a packet channel independently of account
storage/signaling. `RelayMediaChannelFactory::new(address, runtime)` supplies the
native UDP/DTLS/SCTP channel, so a private, on-demand native relay can keep account
credentials in the existing Durable Object.

A direct browser RTCPeerConnection is not yet qualified: the native implementation
skips remote DTLS certificate verification, and `RelayEndpointParams` carries ICE
credentials but no remote certificate fingerprint. Browsers cannot apply that skip.
Do not ship a Call control claiming working audio based only on SDK API availability.
The bounded authenticated relay channel is implemented in
`packages/whatsover-relay`, with its private on-demand container service in
`apps/whatsover-relay-cloudflare`. `src/relay.ts` and the engine's
`wasm/relay.rs` implement the host and Rust transport seams, including migration,
bounded receive queues, loss accounting and cleanup. Synthetic workerd tests
exercise packets through the actual WASM trait. The account lifecycle installs
`configureRelay` with the private relay binding. The WASM call controller exposes
start/answer, PCM input, PCM/Opus output, mute, reject and remote termination.
Generation checks prevent late cleanup from clearing a newer call. Incoming
offers are bounded and creator-checked.

The account's browser voice channel uses single-use, origin-bound tickets and
durable attempt IDs to prevent automatic redials. It limits frames and commands,
ends calls on missed heartbeats/disconnect, and drains pending WASM borrows
before shutdown. A separate upgrade-only gateway lives in
`apps/whatsover-voice-cloudflare`; account RPC and the native relay stay private.

Hype now supplies browser microphone/playback and visible start/answer/decline,
mute and hang-up controls. Its AudioWorklet produces 960-sample, 16 kHz PCM
frames; playback accepts PCM and WebCodecs Opus with bounded queues. Local mute
gates microphone tracks immediately. Cancellation/navigation release media and
close the account voice socket. A browser without the required audio APIs reports
the failure instead of leaving an inaudible call running.

Synthetic Chromium checks exercise capture, PCM and Opus playback, microphone
cleanup, and all five themes at desktop/mobile widths. These checks do not prove
interoperability with an official WhatsApp client: a separately authorized live
call is still required for each media mode before claiming end-to-end interoperability.
The relay's fixed STUN probe qualifies UDP egress without any WhatsApp traffic;
it is not proof of a working WhatsApp call. Keep credentials and signaling in
the account DO. Do not expose the relay's WebSocket or token to the browser.

Cloudflare's default deferred code update can retain the previous account-object
code for five minutes while its WhatsApp socket is active. A successful Worker
upload does not establish that an existing account has adopted the new methods.
Verify `callSnapshot` and connection recovery after that grace period. The
existing one-minute recovery alarm resumes the paired session after reset.


Video-from-start calls use the SDK's H.264 source/sink for outgoing and incoming
direct calls. The browser encodes Constrained Baseline Annex-B at 640x360/15fps,
keeps camera permission tied to explicit video start/answer actions, and provides
local preview, remote video, camera-off, microphone mute and hang-up. Voice-only
calls do not open the camera. Mid-call audio-to-video upgrades and group video
are not implemented.

For video calls, browser PCM is prefixed with byte 0. Video packets in either
direction are byte 2, a keyframe flag, quarter-turn orientation, a big-endian u32
90kHz capture timestamp, and one Annex-B access unit (maximum 512 KiB). Byte 3
requests a new local keyframe; byte 4 plus a boolean reports peer camera state. Browser `keyframe` commands request a peer keyframe;
`video-ack` bounds the bridge to four outstanding video frames. Video queues and
codec queues are bounded; decoder loss asks for recovery. Existing voice-only
PCM framing remains compatible. Media is ephemeral and is not stored in the DO.

Synthetic browser loopback verifies actual H.264 encode/decode, camera-off and
resume, audio alongside video, cleanup, and all five themes at mobile/desktop
widths. These checks do not yet prove live phone video interoperability.

## GIF picker integration

Hype can copy compatible media from an organisation's Telegram library into this
account using the existing private `upload` RPC. `animated: true` on an MP4 video
sets WhatsApp's native GIF-playback flag; message projections preserve it for
looping previews. WebP stickers retain the existing 512 KiB limit. Telegram TGS
and WebM stickers require conversion and are excluded from WhatsApp results.
Source/destination authorisation and catalogue caching belong to Hype; this Worker
receives only bounded file bytes and retains its existing immutable send journal.

The browser sends on an explicit picker selection, displays an optimistic message
and reconciles its checkmark with the returned receipt. Uncertain sends are not
retried automatically. `tests/gif-playback.test.ts` verifies the normal WASM
projection for GIFs and ordinary videos.
