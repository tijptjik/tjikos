# Hype Telegram bridge

A private Cloudflare Worker with one SQLite Durable Object per organisation-owned
messaging account. The implementation uses TypeScript, mtcute and a statically
bundled crypto WASM module. It connects to Telegram over MTProto WebSockets; it is
not a Telegram bot and does not require a persistent Linux host.

Hype selects the account only after checking organisation membership or scoped
administration. The bridge never accepts browser credentials or browser-supplied
organisation ownership. Public HTTP requests return 404; Hype uses a private
service binding named `TELEGRAM`.

## State and connection lifetime

D1 stores organisation accounts, user preferences and verified recipient identities,
conversation/message projections, and audited send intents. The account Durable
Object stores Telegram protocol/session data, a replay journal, attachments, and
outbox deduplication. Session credentials never enter D1 or browser responses.

Each inbox/configuration tab renews a lease. Operators share one platform session.
Leases expire after 75 seconds, with a 30-second idle grace period. Suspension
retains the login. A subsequent viewer resumes enabled accounts and catches up.
No-viewer accounts do not process notifications or automated replies in real time.
Explicit Disconnect disables the account for every operator.
SDK requests have a 30-second deadline. Stop and idle expiry cancel pending
requests before draining background history and disposing the SDK, so a stalled
login or send cannot indefinitely hold the account online. Interrupted sends
remain uncertain instead of being retried automatically.

Initial connection imports up to 30 recent dialogs and 30 messages per dialog.
Live message, edit, deletion and reaction updates enter the durable replay journal.
Saved D1 history remains readable when a provider bridge is unavailable.
The shared chat UI can load older Telegram messages in pages of 30. Native
message-ID cursors are separate from the incoming-event replay cursor. Independent
history imports do not acknowledge intervening live events, and stale pages cannot
overwrite newer edits or resurrect deleted messages. “Find more conversations”
discovers further dialogs, including archived chats, without changing the selected
chat or live replay cursor. Access hashes remain inside the SDK; public pagination
anchors contain only peer IDs, message IDs and timestamps.

## Local development

Install from the TjikOS workspace root with `bun install`. Use a private persistence
directory outside the repository for real session data. Supply `TELEGRAM_API_ID`
and `TELEGRAM_API_HASH` from a secure environment outside the checkout; never put
credentials or account captures in source files.

From this app directory, run the local worker explicitly:

```sh
bun x wrangler dev --env='' --local --port 8794 --persist-to /secure/local/hype-telegram
```

For calls, also run `bun x wrangler dev --env='' --local --port 8795` from
`apps/telegram-calls-cloudflare`. Hype's local `TELEGRAM_CALLS_URL` is
`ws://127.0.0.1:8795/calls`. This public upgrade-only gateway connects to the
private bridge's `CallGateway` entrypoint; it cannot register accounts or send
messages. Its local service binding never points at production.

Hype's local `TELEGRAM` binding points to `hype-telegram-local` with `remote=false`.
Its WhatsApp binding likewise points to `hype-whatsover-local`; the WhatsApp apps
have explicit `local` and `preview` environments. Local development does not use
the production messaging bridge.

Open the organisation's Messaging tab to register/sign in. Telegram supports QR,
phone-code and two-step-verification password challenges. The account belongs to
the organisation; the registering operator is retained only for attribution.
The shared chat model requires an explicit organisation-bound transport. Legacy
administrator-owned WhatsApp endpoints return a migration error before accessing
any provider. Their old linked-device data is retained, but is not automatically
assigned to an organisation from an operator's memberships. Link the intended
organisation account explicitly; copying existing sessions would require an
explicit account-to-organisation mapping.

## Validation and release

```sh
bun run types
bun run check
bun run test
bun run build
```

Tests run in workerd with synthetic credentials and mocked network transport. They
cover SDK storage across eviction, MTProto crypto and WebSocket handshake, account
isolation, replay ordering, deletion tombstones, reactions, and ambiguous sends.
They also cover older-history cursors, real SDK cancellation on Stop/idle expiry,
and independent call-crypto vectors (DH, directional AES-CTR, tampering and replay).
`build` performs a Wrangler deployment dry run; it does not deploy.

The preview and production Worker names are `hype-telegram-preview` and
`hype-telegram-prod`. Configure both required secrets separately in the intended
environment before deploying it. Deployment order is the private bridge, matching
call gateway (`hype-telegram-calls-preview` or `hype-telegram-calls-prod`), then the
Hype release that consumes their binding and URL. Apply the reviewed D1 migration
in that same Hype environment. The bridge and call gateway were deployed to production on 2026-11-04.
Production Hype still needs the messaging application release and migrations;
deploying the bridge alone does not enable its inbox.

## GIF and sticker catalogue

The private service exposes `searchMedia`, `stickerPacks`, `catalogItem`,
`catalogMedia` and `stageMedia` for a
connected organisation account. GIF search uses Telegram's configured inline bot;
empty queries show saved GIFs where available. Sticker search uses native
`messages.searchStickers` keyword/emoji search; empty queries show recent stickers.
Provider continuation offsets are preserved for pagination. Installed packs use
`messages.getAllStickers`; a public pack short name loads up to 200 members with
`messages.getStickerSet`. Hype caches pages and previews on the device.
`compatibleWith: "whatsapp"` filters results to MP4 GIFs and WebP stickers of at
most 512 KiB for Hype’s authorised copy into the same organisation’s WhatsApp account.

The account Durable Object retains private document/file references and returns
opaque UUIDs to Hype. Search results expire after 15 minutes; explicitly staged
attachments survive object eviction for 24 hours and use the existing immutable
send journal. The staging RPC never sends a message. Hype now follows the operator’s selection
immediately with an immutable send and displays an optimistic preview.
Acknowledged selections are released; uncertain selections remain available until expiry. The browser can preview
MP4/GIF, WebP, TGS and WebM; previews are bounded to 8 MiB. Downloads allow two concurrent previews per account, separately from the mutation
queue, so preview loading does not block sending. External GIF downloads
accept only HTTPS Tenor/Giphy CDN URLs from the configured bot, without redirects.

`tests/catalog.test.ts` covers native search, pagination, account isolation,
selection durability, expiry, download limits and provider-reference privacy.
Live local checks have also retrieved GIFs and all supported sticker formats,
downloaded previews, decoded a real TGS animation and staged selections. Message
sending remains subject to the live qualification described below.

## Voice and video calls

The private bridge implements phone call RPCs, incoming ringing receipts,
ephemeral DH commitment/fingerprint verification, authenticated replay-protected
AES-CTR signalling, gzip and SCTP. It advertises Telegram library versions 13.0.0
and 12.0.0 (V3 framing) only. Unknown DH groups and unsupported signalling
transports fail closed. Account access hashes and shared keys never reach the
browser.

One operator owns a call. The browser obtains a single-use 30-second capability
bound to its origin and active viewer lease, and sends it in a WebSocket
subprotocol, never in a URL. Other operators can view shared call state and
decline unanswered calls, but cannot control the owner's media. Socket loss,
lease expiry, explicit disconnect, or hangup releases the call. Setup is limited
to 90 seconds and call duration to two hours. A submitted attempt is never
automatically retried.

Hype uses native WebRTC with Opus/VP8. Telegram's independent send-only channel
negotiations are translated to stable browser SDP sections; peer fields are
validated before SDP construction. Media travels through browser WebRTC, directly
or through Telegram-provided standard TURN endpoints. Telegram's private native
reflector protocol is not implemented. When Telegram forbids P2P, the browser is
configured relay-only. Mute, camera gating, remote playback, and cancellation
release the relevant browser resources.

In the Hype checkout, `bun scripts/dev/check-telegram-media.ts` runs reproducible
voice-only and video browser loopbacks using synthetic capture devices and no
Telegram connection. It checks bidirectional received RTP, decoded video frames,
mute/camera controls, and media teardown. Hype's `telegram-calls.test.ts` covers
malformed peer fields, the native SSRC answer contract, relay policy, late
permission/ticket cancellation, and socket backpressure.
Add `--relay` to also qualify both media modes through real local UDP and TCP TURN
allocations with P2P disabled. This needs Go 1.24+ and builds the pinned Pion TURN
fixture in a temporary directory. Listeners, relay allocations and permitted
peers are restricted to loopback; credentials are generated for each run and are
not printed. The check verifies that the selected local and remote ICE candidates
are relays, confirms the UDP/TCP relay transport, and stops the fixture on exit.
Add `--native-fields` to emit Telegram's native video codec `channels: 0` sentinel
at the signalling boundary. `--relay --native-fields` has passed all six local
voice/video cases across direct, UDP TURN and TCP TURN connections. The fixture
checks native field compatibility; it does not connect to a native Telegram client.
Bridge tests also cover authenticated uncompressed JSON signalling, which native
tgcalls accepts alongside gzip, and reject tampered packets before parsing.

**Authenticated live qualification remains outstanding.** The production bridge
completed a real Telegram QR handshake on 2026-11-04 through an authenticated
remote service binding. The QR became available on the second one-second poll;
explicit Stop returned in approximately 1.1 seconds and cleared it. These timings
include the remote development proxy and are not browser latency measurements.
A second run verified that two viewers shared the pending QR session, a separate
account saw no QR or connection, and leaving both viewers cleared the QR and
suspended the session by the 33.3-second poll (the configured grace is 30 seconds).
No account was signed in and no message or call was sent in those checks.

Synthetic tests and build dry runs
do not prove interoperability with released Telegram clients. Before general use,
qualify sign-in, catch-up, attachments, incoming/outgoing voice and video against
native clients, relay-only connectivity, simultaneous operators, and reconnection
using explicitly approved test accounts and recipients. No real messages or
calls have been sent during implementation.
